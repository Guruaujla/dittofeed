title: "Keyed Performed Segment"
description: "Condition on whether users have performed a specific action - Immediately."
---

The keyed performed segment allows you to condition on whether users have performed a specific action - immediately. This is in contrast to standard segments whose values are calculated with a delay.

This is an advanced feature that are used within Event Entry Node [journeys](/resources/journey-nodes/entry#event-entry).

Use cases include:

- Waiting for a user to cancel an existing appointment in an event entry journey.
- Checking if a delivery has been completed in an event entry journey.

## Implementation Details

This segment node is unique, in that it is *not* calculated asynchronously in ClickHouse. Instead, segment assignments are calculated synchronously in memory. This guarantees that the segment value will incorporate the triggering events' when evaluating segment splits and wait-for nodes.

## Example Journey - Appointment Reminders

To see an example of how to set up an appointment reminder journey which makes use of the keyed performed segment, see the [Appointment Reminders](/guide/sample-journeys/appointment-reminders) guide.
