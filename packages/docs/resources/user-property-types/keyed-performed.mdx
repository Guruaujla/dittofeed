## Keys

Keys are used to route the event used to resolve this user property to the correct event entry journey instance. If for example you receive an appointment update event, you can specify the `appointmentId` as the key to route this event to event entry journey instances keyed on that appointment id.

```json
{
  "event": "APPOINTMENT_UPDATED",
  "type": "track",
  "properties": {
    "appointmentId": "123",
    "appointmentTime": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Implementation Details

This user property is unique, in that it is *not* calculated asynchronously in ClickHouse. Instead, the value is calculated synchronously in memory. This guarantees that the user property value will incorporate the triggering events' properties when rendering message templates within the journey.

## Example Journey - Appointment Reminders

To see an example of how to set up an appointment reminder journey which makes use of the keyed performed user property, see the [Appointment Reminders](/guide/sample-journeys/appointment-reminders) guide.
