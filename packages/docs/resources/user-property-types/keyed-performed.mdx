title: "Keyed Performed - User Property"
description: "Renders the value of a specific event property - immediately."
---

The keyed performed user property allows you to render the properties of `track` events - immediately. This is in contrast to standard segments whose values are calculated with a delay.

This is an advanced feature that are used within Event Entry Node [journeys](/resources/journey-nodes/entry#event-entry).

Use cases include:

- Rendering the booking name for an appointment reminder journey.
- Rendering order details for a delivery completion journey.

## Keys

Keys are used to route the event used to resolve this user property to the correct event entry journey instance. If for example you receive an appointment update event, you can specify the `appointmentId` as the key to route this event to event entry journey instances keyed on that appointment id.

```json
{
  "event": "APPOINTMENT_UPDATED",
  "type": "track",
  "properties": {
    "appointmentId": "123",
    "bookingName": "John Doe",
    "appointmentTime": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Implementation Details

This user property is unique, in that it is *not* calculated asynchronously in ClickHouse. Instead, the value is calculated synchronously in memory. This guarantees that the user property value will incorporate the triggering events' properties when rendering message templates within the journey.

## Example Journey - Appointment Reminders

To see an example of how to set up an appointment reminder journey which makes use of the keyed performed user property, see the [Appointment Reminders](/guide/sample-journeys/appointment-reminders) guide.
